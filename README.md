This is an ongoing svelte project that aims to consume api data while taking in user inputs and exporting data.

This project offers the oppurtunity to not only create something that I thought of in my head, but also practice my javascript, html, and css, aswell as
learning how to create component based Ui's.

Come to this repo to see my progress!
